1. Stream handshake error.  
When you get an error something like this,  
check your ip port-fowarding settings.  
For example, when you set the rtsp streaming port to 9999,  
check that port 9999 are forwarded.  


2. Streaming video is distorted or broken.  
The reason why video isn't displayed well is about the stream width and height.  
Every rtsp video has a default size, sometimes you should explicit that size like this.  

```
stream = new Stream({  
      name: 'sample_stream',  
      streamUrl: 'stream_url',  
      wsPort: 9999,  
      width: 1920,  
      height: 1080  
});
```

3. Nothing displayed in screen without single error.  
This error might caused by npm modules.  
Generally there's a two modules are used for rtsp streaming.  
One is `ws` and the other is `rtsp-node-stream`.  
If there's vulnerabilities that can't fixed by `npm audit fix` when installing those modules,  
you'd check that module folders inside.  
Maybe some differences between normally installed and vulnerabilities occured.  
If that, just copy normally installed module folders and paste into your server.
